#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[100];
    int age;

    printf("Enter name: ");
    if (scanf("%s", name) != 1) return 0;

    printf("Enter age: ");
    if (scanf("%d", &age) != 1) return 0;

    FILE *fp = fopen("info.txt", "w");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error creating file!\n");

    }

    fprintf(fp, "Name: %s\nAge: %d\n", name, age);
